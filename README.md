My name is khalid anthony. I'm currently a sophomore at the University at Albany majoring in Comp Sci. My goal is to be a software engineer. I'm proficient in html, css, and java. I'm currently working on learning javascript and its extensive network of frameworks.

I'm also a fan of hip hop and The Office.
